"""
Gets a connection from the pool if one is available, else returns 0.

Notes:
- Set the target number of connections in the pool under typical usage.
- Set a (finite) peak number of connections that the pool can scale to. When these extra connections are released back to the pool they are deleted until the pool size reaches the target.
- The constraint `target_pool_size <= peak_size` is automatically enforced.
- Reset the target and peak numbers as desired.
- When requesting a connection from the pool:
    - If the target has not been reached, get a connection from the `unoccupied` set if there is one, otherwise create a new one.
    - If the target upper bound has been reached:
        - If the peak number has not been reached, create a new connection (and manually delete it when finished).
        - If the peak number has been reached, wait `ms_wait` milliseconds and try again to acquire a connection.
        - Try a maximum of `n_tries` times to acquire a connection from the pool.
        - If all attempts to acquire a connection fail, return the connection pool's connection prototype, which is a disconnected instance of the connection used to instantiate the connection pool.
